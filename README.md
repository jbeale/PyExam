JUSTIN BEALE'S FANCY PYTHON FINAL EXAM PROJECT
==============================================

This is my final exam project for the Python class that is some CSE xxx number that I don't know at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan.

Tech
--------

* SQLite storage
* Django
* Twitter Bootstrap for easy quick frontend (because I wasn't about to spend time on a custom UX design)
* jQuery for the one grading AJAX call that is made
